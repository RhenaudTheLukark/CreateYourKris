# CreateYourKris
Rhenaud The Lukark's Create Your Frisk mod, used to create your own DELTARUNE-like encounters.

This encounter must be used with Create Your Frisk v0.6.2.2 or newer. If you don't know what Create Your Frisk is, here is a link to the subreddit of the engine: https://old.reddit.com/r/Unitale/

Warning: Create Your Kris is basically a huge hack, using everything possible to make it pleasant to use, but it doesn't mean a user who never tried Lua will be able to make something out of it.
Due to its nature, it's a little bit harder to use than CYF itself, and following CYK's documentation is the only way to make sure one doesn't get lost while using it.

I would also like to say that it would be easier for me to provide any help through issues, however please check if your issue hasn't been treated or reported before creating your own.

Finally, like any software, CYK is not perfect, and there is always room for improvement: if you want to contribute to CYK and make it a better engine for everyone, feel free to fork this repository and start working on it! I'll be glad to discuss any changes you'd like to apply to this engine, and even include said changes if they are appropriate!

Create Your Kris would have never existed without the help of: 
    - /u/DimitriB1 | DimitriB1#7677 for giving me some help with Kris' sprites and for giving me an arena library I was able to adapt to CYK! 
    - /u/heartlessmushroom | heartlessmushroom#0194 for the Player name font, the magnificent Poseur animation and for the hours spent testing the engine! 
    - /u/WD200019 | WD200019#8327 who helped me with the code when I needed help the most, for some scripts he gave me and Lua hacks we found together, and for the hours spent testing the engine!
    - Ally 🍦#1540 for the hours spent testing the engine!
